# D3 Visualizations
### Introduction
This project leverages the power of *[Plotly.js](https://plot.ly)* library that is build on top of D3 for performing good, meaningful and advanced data visualization on the web.

Plotly is a open source project and has libraries build in Python, R and MATLAB as well for visualization. Please explore more about these libraries on **[Plotly](https://plot.ly)**.

### Dataset Overview

Various datasets have been used to plot different visulizations as they demand specific type of data for visualization. For demostration purposes some datasets are in _csv_ format while others are in _json_ format to show flexibility of the data types that can be used to plot the graphs.
